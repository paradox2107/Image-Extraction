Tesseract is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine developed initially by HP. It was then open sourced in 2005 since when, Google has been developing new versions.

Tesseract engine is developed in C++. It has a wrapper 'Tess4j' which helps to bind it on Java code.

This github project contains my implementation of the Tesseract API to scan and read basic image and pdf files.
